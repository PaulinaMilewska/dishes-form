## Dish app for HexOcean

In my project I used React Hook Form, Material UI and axios HTTP client. All fields are required. If you don't set values in some fields it will send default values.

Runs the app in the development mode:
# npm start

Unfortunately status 200 is when you click Submit button twice and there is a problem with set seconds. 

I know the application needs a few tweaks, but I hope you like it anyway.
